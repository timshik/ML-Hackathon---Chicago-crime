Help the Chicago Police Prevent Crime!
Police departments around the world are building machine learning systems, which attempt to predict
time, place and type of crimes. With an effective learning system, the police might be able to
direct patrols to certain locations at certain times that are more prone to occurrence of a crime, and
hopefully prevent it from happening in the first place. Youâ€™ll receive a dataset of 35,000 crimes that
happened in Chicago. A sample contains location of the crime (x,y), time, type, and more - see
below.
Challenges:
In this task there is a primary challenge and a secondary challenge. The primary challenge is
classification of crime type: you are required to build a learning system that, given crime feature
vectors  predicts which kind of crime it is, from 5 classes. The secondary
challenge is crime prevention. Every day you can send 30 police cars to the city - you direct a car to

a specific location and a specific time of day. If a crime was about to happen up to 500m from the
location you specified and up to 30 minutes before or after the time you specified, you prevented a
crime! You are required to build a learning system that, given a date in the future, will output 30
(x,y,time) combinations - where time is during that day from midnight to midnight. Police cars will
be sent to these locations at these times.
